Heterogeneous collections
_________________________

Heterogeneous collections are similar to :ref:`homogeneous collections <homogeneous>`
except that the number of the elements is predefined which means they follow the same binding rules.
The most common heterogeneous collection is :py:obj:`typing.Tuple` (like ``Tuple[int, int, int]``)
